## 👋 Introduction

Welcome, and thank you for stopping by my **data science and machine learning portfolio**! 

I'm **Yusuf**, a **part-time analytics postgraduate student at Georgia Tech**, former **engineer at Arup**, and an aspiring **industry-based data science and machine learning professional**. This space brings together projects I've worked on through **academic research**, **collaborations with universities**, and **self-guided learning**.

These projects reflect my experience working with **real-world data**, where I've applied **data science and machine learning techniques** like **statistical analysis**, **regression modelling**, and **time series forecasting** to uncover useful insights. While much of my work has been shaped by **research-driven challenges**, I've also taken the initiative to **explore ideas independently** and build out complete workflows from **data preparation to model evaluation**.

My background so far has been focused mostly on **academic and research settings**, but the skills I've developed are relevant to many areas where data plays a central role. I'm always looking to **expand into new problem spaces** and continue learning through **hands-on work**.

## Project 1: Forecasting Univariate Daily Rainfall for an Undisclosed Station in Malaysia (2025 - ongoing)

### 🔍 Overview
Research-led project focused on **daily rainfall forecasting** using univariate time series data from Malaysia. Built in collaboration with Sunway University to improve localized weather prediction using machine learning.

### 📊 Data & Features
- ~3500 rows of historical daily rainfall data  
- Time-series engineered features:
  - Lagged rainfall, accumulated rainfall
  - Rainfall spell tracking
  - Seasonality (month, day) encodings

### 🧠 Methods & Models
- Classical ML: XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost  
- Neural Networks: Feedforward NN (TensorFlow), LSTM/Transformer groundwork  
- Hyperparameter tuning: Optuna  
- Interpretability: SHAP for tree-based models

### 📈 Results & Evaluation
- RMSE/MAE across different models  
- Improved performance through domain-informed feature engineering and model tuning

### 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
`Python`, `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `XGBoost`, `LightGBM`, `CatBoost`, `TensorFlow`, `Optuna`, `SHAP`, `Scikit-learn`, `PyTorch`

### 💡 Key Takeaways
- Demonstrated the power of tailored feature engineering for small and noisy datasets  
- Gained insights into how model interpretability tools like SHAP support environmental forecasting
