## 👋 Introduction

Welcome, and thank you for stopping by my data science and machine learning portfolio! 

I'm Yusuf, a part-time analytics postgraduate student at Georgia Tech, former engineer at Arup, and an aspiring industry-based data science and machine learning professional. This space brings together projects I've worked on through academic research, collaborations with universities, and self-guided learning.

These projects reflect my experience working with real-world data, where I've applied data science and machine learning techniques like statistical analysis, regression modelling, and time series forecasting to uncover useful insights. While much of my work has been shaped by research-driven challenges, I've also taken the initiative to explore ideas independently and build out complete workflows from data preparation to model evaluation.

My background so far has been focused mostly on academic and research settings, but the skills I've developed are relevant to many areas where data plays a central role. I'm always looking to expand into new problem spaces and continue learning through hands-on work.

## Rain-Net: Daily Rainfall Forecasting (2025 - ongoing)

### 🔍 Overview
Research-led project focused on **daily rainfall forecasting** using univariate time series data from Malaysia. Built in collaboration with Sunway University to improve localized weather prediction using machine learning.

### 📊 Data & Features
- ~3500 rows of historical daily rainfall data  
- Time-series engineered features:
  - Lagged rainfall, accumulated rainfall
  - Rainfall spell tracking
  - Seasonality (month, day) encodings

### 🧠 Methods & Models
- Classical ML: XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost  
- Neural Networks: Feedforward NN (TensorFlow), LSTM/Transformer groundwork  
- Hyperparameter tuning: Optuna  
- Interpretability: SHAP for tree-based models

### 📈 Results & Evaluation
- RMSE/MAE across different models  
- Improved performance through domain-informed feature engineering and model tuning

### 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
`Python`, `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `XGBoost`, `LightGBM`, `CatBoost`, `TensorFlow`, `Optuna`, `SHAP`, `Scikit-learn`, `PyTorch`

### 💡 Key Takeaways
- Demonstrated the power of tailored feature engineering for small and noisy datasets  
- Gained insights into how model interpretability tools like SHAP support environmental forecasting
